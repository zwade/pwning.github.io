To celebrate the 10th anniversary of PPP, we're happy to announce a new official website and blog. In addition to hosting information about the team &mdash; such as sponsors, events, and updates &mdash; we will begin migrating our published write-ups from our [github repository](https://github.com/pwning/public-writeup) to this blog. 

## Announcements

Beyond the new website, we also have some exciting announcements about PlaidCTF 2019. Stay posted for more details.
