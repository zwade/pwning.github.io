## CTF

Capture The Flag (CTF) is a computer security wargame, where each participating team competes to find the flags (small keys) by solving problems. These problems often relate to one of several aspects of security such as web hacking, reverse engineering, exploitation, forensics, cryptography, and more.

## PPP

Plaid Parliament of Pwning is a CTF team from Carnegie Mellon University formed in 2009. Comprised of undergrads, graduate students, and alumni, the PPP competes internationally in many of top security competitions. As well as competing, PPP also hosts our own competition, a challenging and fun competition called [PlaidCTF](http://plaidctf.com).
